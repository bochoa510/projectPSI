# for Rev3 fix layout design problems:

   I2C pins, pull up resistors
   
   pull down resistors for transistors
  

# for Rev3 goal is to have self contained pcb:

  5v relay moodule w/ isolation
  
  16bit adc module 

# I would like to include surface mount components:

  capacitors
  
  resistors
  
  diodes
  
  atmega328p (maybe)
